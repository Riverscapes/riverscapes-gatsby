We want to change the trajectory of this ecological story.\n\nThreats to riverscape health are intensifying worldwide and we want to change the trajectory of this ecological story.  The Riverscapes Consortium (RC) helps people who care about riverscape health to make a difference in their communities and contribute to a broader global conversation with concerned people ready to take action. The effects of riverscape degradation are far-reaching and extreme events such as flooding, fires, and droughts threaten the fresh water supply for all living species. \n\nThrough our platforms, we encourage an exchange of knowledge, support, and sharing between anyone with a stake and interest in their riverscapes. Together, we can tackle the crisis of riverscape health with the urgency it deserves. \n\n## Benefits of working with the RC\n\nOne of our primary goals is to make it easier to catalogue, discover, and share observations of riverscapes so we can improve the future of riverscape health. \n\nWe lower the barriers to creating, contributing, and sharing the products of riverscapes analysis, monitoring and modeling. The benefit to members is that they can more easily track responses to floods, fires and droughts while sharing ongoing restoration and conservation efforts. \n\nWe have adopted and developed data standards for organizing and visualizing common river datasets. We have also created tools that automate the collection of disparate public data to make it easier for researchers, restoration practitioners, scientists, and students to study and manage riverscapes.\n\nBy developing the RC Exchange and Riverscape Compliant Models, we’re working towards solving the pressing challenge of riverscape degradation through open source and FAIR tools that foster awareness, action, and impact in communities worldwide.  \n\n![Our Work](./our-work-image.jpg)\n\n## Explore, share and solve\n\nLearn how you can contribute to improving riverscape health and build solutions that reduce the degradation of riverscapes in our communities. \n \nWhether you want to host a project, contribute a model, or are just curious about improving riverscape health in your community, we welcome and encourage your participation in the RC.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Our Work","date":"May 20, 2023","description":"Our Work Page","banner":true,"isHome":null},"tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#benefits-of-working-with-the-rc","title":"Benefits of working with the RC"},{"url":"#explore-share-and-solve","title":"Explore, share and solve"}]}},"allMdx":{"nodes":[{"id":"5a0167c7-ce56-5da6-90e3-3e55ede3e73c","fields":{"slug":"/our-work/apps"},"frontmatter":{"description":"Apps Page","title":"Apps","blurb":"Sample blurb","isHome":null,"imageAlt":"Image Alt Sample","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#5898e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/5d28f/card-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/4fb08/card-image.jpg 200w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/c3215/card-image.jpg 400w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/5d28f/card-image.jpg 800w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/b710d/card-image.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/1dc03/card-image.webp 200w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/bc949/card-image.webp 400w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/4eb70/card-image.webp 800w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/45dfe/card-image.webp 1600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":523}}}}},{"id":"5ac1b05e-338b-5bd6-8897-d9b0122b76ae","fields":{"slug":"/our-work/data-exchange"},"frontmatter":{"description":"Data Exchange detail","title":"Data Exchange","blurb":"Sample blurb 2","isHome":null,"imageAlt":"Image Alt Sample","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#5898e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/5d28f/card-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/4fb08/card-image.jpg 200w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/c3215/card-image.jpg 400w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/5d28f/card-image.jpg 800w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/b710d/card-image.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/1dc03/card-image.webp 200w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/bc949/card-image.webp 400w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/4eb70/card-image.webp 800w,\n/static/67c69fdc6628b666811efbb3c961b81f/45dfe/card-image.webp 1600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":523}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0aecad08-1e15-5b40-a0b7-544e452451f0","frontmatter":{"title":"Our Work","date":"2023-05-20T22:12:03.284Z","description":"Our Work Page","banner":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1410704205","2841359383","3612203818"],"slicesMap":{}}
