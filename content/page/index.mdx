> Riverscapes, vital for our existence and survival, continuously shape their channels and floodplains, nurturing diverse ecosystems that thrive on their dynamic nature. 

But riverscapes and the people and ecosystems that rely on them are increasingly more vulnerable to floods, fires and droughts exacerbated by the climate crisis. 
 
The Riverscapes Consortium is dedicated to changing the trajectory of this story by equipping members with what they need to help restore and conserve healthy riverscapes around the world.

        # Learn
        The Riverscapes Consortium has the people, tools, and data that can help. But first, it's critical to understand our relationship with riverscapes.
        ### What is a riverscape and why do they matter?

          Over time, the popular idea of what a river stream _should be_ has caught hold. Perhaps, you have an image in your mind of a long, winding channel flowing effortlessly through the landscape. 

          But this image may be part of the problem. Because rivers are more than a channel that delivers water. A healthy riverscape is an integrated system within a valley bottom, frequently connected to their floodplains, supporting vibrant ecosystems of wildlife habitat, wetlands, and vegetation.

        ## Solve
        We want to support you in solving complex ecosystem challenges related to riverscapes in a number of ways:

        - Share your snapshots of riverscapes such as adding your photos to a repeat photo-series in [Phlux](https://phlux.riverscapes.net)
        - Conduct your own monitoring, assessment, designs and analyses in [Riverscapes Studio](https://qris.riverscapes.net)
        - Leverage existing model runs and datasets from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net) to better understand your riverscapes
        - Contribute your observations to the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net).
        - Share your efforts to solve problems such as restoration design, analysis, or model-run in a F-A-I-R way with others on the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net)
        - Join one of the many existing Riverscapes Consortium communities or start your own
        - Share your own model/tool code or Riverscapes-Compliant models for use by the community  


        Whether you are a riverscape practitioner, or simply curious about how to take the first step in helping solve these urgent challenges facing riverscapes, we encourage you to start by exploring your own riverscapes with our [Riverscapes Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net) and  by joining the Riverscapes Consortium with a free account in our [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net).
